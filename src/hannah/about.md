This site is built with Metalsmith, with inspiration from [a great tutorial](https://neustadt.fr/essays/crafting-a-simple-blog-with-metalsmith/) by Parimal Satyal. The design is adapted from [this CSS template](http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_portfolio.htm) from W3-schools, and the handwriting-style font is created with [myscriptfont.com](http://myscriptfont.com).
